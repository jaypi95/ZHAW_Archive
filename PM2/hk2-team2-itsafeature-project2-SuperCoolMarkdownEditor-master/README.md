‚öôÔ∏è Build from source
-----------------
To build SuperCoolMarkDown, you need the following:

* [Gradle] - v6.8+
* [Java] - v11+
-------------

1. You need to download Gradle and a Java JDK manually if you don't have them installed already. All other dependencies will be downloaded automatically after loading the gradle project.
1. To generate an executable, you first need to generate a jar file. That's as simple as running
```sh
gradle build
```
You'll find your jar file in `build/libs/SuperCoolMarkDown-xx.jar`. To execute it, run 
```sh
java -jar SuperCoolMarkDown-xx.jar
```
3. To package the jar file in an executable use [launch4j][]. You can use `launch4j.conf.xml` to load the config. Make sure to update the path to the jar file, press the gear icon to create the executable, and voil√†!

To clean everything run `gradle clean` or simply delete `build/`.
